# CapchamathPuzzle
A project on Java Swing CAPTCHA mathematical puzzle involves creating a graphical user interface (GUI) application that generates a CAPTCHA puzzle for the user to solve. CAPTCHA is an acronym for "Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart." The goal of a CAPTCHA puzzle is to verify that the user attempting to access a website or application is human, and not a computer program.

In this project, the CAPTCHA puzzle will be a mathematical problem presented in a graphical format using Java Swing components. The user will be required to enter the solution to the problem in order to proceed. The problem will be randomly generated by the application and will involve basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The project will involve creating a Java class that generates the mathematical problem and a Java Swing GUI that presents the problem to the user and accepts their input. The GUI will include text fields for the user to enter their answer and a button to submit their solution. The application will also include error checking to ensure that the user enters a valid numerical answer.

To enhance the security of the CAPTCHA puzzle, the application can also include a time limit for the user to solve the problem and a limit on the number of attempts they can make before being locked out. This will prevent automated programs from repeatedly attempting to solve the puzzle and gaining unauthorized access.

Overall, this project on Java Swing CAPTCHA mathematical puzzle will provide a practical example of using Java programming and graphical user interface design to create a useful application for improving website and application security.
